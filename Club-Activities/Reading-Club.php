            <p class="workplace-section__content">Reading Club was initiated on 30/8/16 exclusively for first year Tamil, Kannada, Telugu and Hindi Medium Students in the library. Reading Club is a network of Students’ readers run in the college library to encourage reading for pleasure. The prime motive of this reading club initiation was to promote the importance of English among the students in the college. The students were grouped into teams and asked to select books on their own interest. They were asked to create a wall dictionary in their classrooms with the unfamiliar words they come across. They were asked to notate the important points and indulge in a short discussion for every week when they meet in the library. When they complete reading their chosen books they were asked to meet and share their pleasure of reading.</p>
