            <p class="workplace-section__content">The central meaning of innovation relates to renewal or improvement, with novelty being a consequence of this improvement. It is quite necessary for people to change the way they make decisions or make choices outside their norms. On a lower level, innovation can be seen as a change in the thought process for doing something or useful application of inventions or discoveries. It may refer to incremental, emergent or radical and revolutionary changes in thinking, products, processes or organizations.</p>
            <p class="workplace-section__content">To provide all sorts of technical assistance and support service to students for developing new concepts, products and thereby ensure that innovation is a part of quality education.</p>
            <p class="workplace-section__content">Engineering education lacks practical orientation knowledge because of the absence of opportunities to develop new products during the course. If this can be solved in the campus , the transformation of a student into a professional will be explosive.</p>
