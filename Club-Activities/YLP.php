            <br>
            <p class="workplace-section__content">Each Youth Leadership Program group is limited to 25 people. Participants are selected by the sponsoring Toastmasters club or by a cooperating organization.</p>
            <p class="workplace-section__content">A local Toastmasters club serves as sponsor and provides a coordinator to present the program. The individual coordinator attends each meeting, where he or she will lead most of the presentations and counsel participants. The coordinator assigns an assistant who can fill in for the coordinator should he or she be unable to attend a meeting. Meetings generally follow a format similar to that of a Toastmasters club meeting, including an announced agenda, practice in parliamentary procedure, and the selection of presiding officers.</p>
