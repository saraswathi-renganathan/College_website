            <p class="workplace-section__content">The orators program is important because it is critical for young people to learn to express themselves clearly and precisely. This program increases self-confidence and keeps from fading into the background. The youngsters are learning life skills as well as how to present themselves in business situations. Winning first place not only celebrates a level of accomplished excellence, Orators club is to develop public speaking skills, confidence and the unique talents of the participating youths. There will be a competition involving orators speaking for not less than five minutes and not more than 10 minutes. The participants were judged on eye contact, voice projection, diction, knowledge of the piece and expression. Rather than sitting back and letting others lead, we can lead and take charge.</p>
