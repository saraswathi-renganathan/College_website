            <p class="hakuna-common-banner-description__content">The department of Computer Science and Engineering was established in the year 2011 with an intake of 60 students. The Department has been maintaining high standards in imparting quality education in the challenging field of Computer Science. Highly experienced and dedicated faculty members with minimum M.E / M.Tech qualification impart quality training to students, with solid emphasis on understanding the fundamentals and intricacies of the subjects concerned and subsequently apply them to solve problems. The Department has successfully conducted Technical Symposiums and has arranged a number of seminars and several invited lectures by eminent persons both from academia and industry. The Department has well established lab facilities with advanced software suited to the syllabus prescribed by the University.</p>
            <p class="hakuna-common-banner-description__content">
                The Department is adopting new innovative teaching methodology to meet PEOs (Programme Educational Objectives). It is organizing technical activities in tutorial periods for the enhancement of students skills. It has organized short-term course for students on ANDROID which will bridge the gap between Academia and Industry. It is also encouraging students to develop in-house project so that they can meet the industrial requirements, by adopting standard Project Development Process.</p>
            <p class="hakuna-common-banner-description__content">
                Our department has been recognized by IIT Bombay to act as a nodal centre for all its distance digital learning process. It has also been bestowed with virtual classroom facilities. We have signed MOU with NPTEL for displaying the lectures by the eminent professors of Computer Science and Engineering.</p>
            <p class="hakuna-common-banner-description__content">
                The faculties of the department are the members of Indian Society for Technical Education (ISTE) and Computer Society of India (CSI). The Department of Computer Science and Engineering has primary objective of providing world class education in the field of Computer Science. The department is combining excellence in education and research with reference to the industry. Right from its inception, the Department has been offering phenomenal infrastructural facilities with a variety of computing platforms to professional students to meet the burgeoning demands of the IT industry.</p>
