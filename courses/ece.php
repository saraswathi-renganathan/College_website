                <!-- <p>Considering the importance of conserving natural resources, proper land management and to provide quality education on agriculture to the rural masses, the department of Agriculture Engineering was established in the year 2016 with a permissible intake of 60 students. The institute vows to promote agriculture by conducting need analysis to bridge the gap between agriculture and latest technology. Primary motive for offering this course is to serve the farming community by inculcating the effective utilization of available resources with the motto: “Resources are limited but creativity is unlimited’. The institute has planned to provide state-of-the-art agricultural practices to the farmers and the society at large, ‘for a better and a greener tomorrow’.</p> -->
